## **Exercise 2 – Miro Quest: Proof Adventures**
**Responsible**: Orynbassar Abylaikhan

**Tool Selected:** Miro
**Link**:

**Type of Game:** Educational RPG / Quest Game

* Students solve “proof puzzles” to progress.
* Drag-and-drop and flowchart interactions make abstract concepts tangible.

**General Idea:**
Students play as an engineer saving the world by “hacking” enemy systems using mathematical proofs.

**Gameplay Concept:**

* 5 Quests based on different proof techniques (e.g., induction, contradiction, modular arithmetic, Euclidean algorithm, prime uniqueness).

**Crypto Concept Explained:**
Number-theoretic proofs justify why cryptographic functions work, e.g., proving modular exponentiation is well-defined or that only primes have unique inverses modulo n.

**Type of Game:** Puzzle / Competition

* Students solve challenges against the clock.
* Leaderboard scoring adds a competitive element.
* Drag-and-drop matching (LearningApps/H5P) can make it more interactive.

**General Idea:**
Students navigate a sequence of puzzles related to number theory, unlocking “treasures” (points) as they answer correctly.

**Stages:**

* Stage 1 – Prime Numbers & Divisibility
* Stage 2 – GCD & LCM, Euclidean Algorithm
* Stage 3 – Simple Proof Concepts

**Extra Features:**

* Countdown timer per question.
* Instant feedback with explanations.
* Hint buttons for guidance.

**Crypto Concept Explained:**
Understanding primes, modular arithmetic, and GCD is essential for cryptography, e.g., for RSA keys, modular inverses, and secure communication.
